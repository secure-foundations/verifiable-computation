Verifiable computation schemes enable a client to outsource the computation of a function F on various inputs to an untrusted worker, and then verify the correctness of the returned results. Critically, the outsourcing and verification procedures must be more efficient than performing the computation itself. 

This repository hosts code for the [Pinocchio](./pinocchio) and [Geppetto](./geppetto) Verifiable Computation systems.  It was previously hosted on (the now defunct) [Codeplex](http://vc.codeplex.com/).
